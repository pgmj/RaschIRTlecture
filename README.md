# Introduction to Item Response Theory and Rasch Measurement Theory

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/724146949.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10276564)

This is a repository with lecture slides and code for a 3h lecture given at Uppsala University in November of 2023. The code to create the slides is available in the file `RaschIRTlecture.qmd`.

The slides are made with [Quarto](https://www.quarto.org) and can be viewed on GitHub Pages at: <https://pgmj.github.io/RaschIRTlecture/slides.html>

More materials on Rasch analysis in R can be found in the vignette for my [R package `easyRasch`](https://pgmj.github.io/easyRasch/):
<https://pgmj.github.io/raschrvignette/RaschRvign.html>

If you want to use this material as a teacher you can [clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and use the file `RaschIRTlecture-speaker.html` [file in the root directory](https://github.com/pgmj/RaschIRTlecture/blob/main/RaschIRTlecture-speaker.html) to present. The "-speaker" file uses the [multiplex function in Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#multiplex), which makes students (that view the slides using the previous link/file) automatically follow along when you change slide. Very useful, especially in online teaching but also in a live class.

The speaker view has a "notes" section that you can use to read the lecture notes. You can also find these in the source code (the .qmd file) by searching for "footer".
